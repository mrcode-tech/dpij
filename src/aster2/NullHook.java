// TODO: 1/22/2024 Command Design pattern - sample COMMAND Hooks - with command - without template method

//Note that the code doesnâ€™t bother checking whether moldIncompleteHook
//is null, as it is always set to a real Hook object. (Initially, it
//is set to a do-nothing NullHook object, but a user can install a different
//hook.)

//This example demonstrates another pattern, NULL OBJECT [Woolf
//1998], that is only slightly less well known than those in Design Patterns.
//This pattern lets us avoid a null-pointer check by introducing a
//default object that has no effect. (See Refactoring [Fowler et al. 1999]
public class NullHook implements Hook {
    public void execute(AsterStarPress p) {}
}
