// TODO: 1/27/2024 Visitor Design Pattern
//Displaying the factoryâ€™s machines requires building an instance of
//MachineTreeModel from the factory composite and wrapping this
//model in Swing components

//Many useful behaviors for a machine composite are possible. For
//example, suppose that you need to find a particular machine within
//the factory model. To add this ability without modifying the
//MachineComponent hierarchy, you can create a FindVisitor class
